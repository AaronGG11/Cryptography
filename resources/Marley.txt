Turn your lights down low
And pull your window curtains
Oh, let Jah moon come shining in
Into our life again
Sayin' ooh, it's been a long, long (long, long, long, long) time
I kept this message for you, girl
But it seems I was never on time
Still I wanna get through to you, girlie
On time, on time
I want to give you some love (good, good lovin')
I want to give you some good, good lovin' (good, good lovin')
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Say, I want to give you some good, good lovin' (good, good lovin')
Turn your lights down low
Never try to resist, oh no!
Oh, let my love come tumbling in
Into our life again
Sayin' ooh, I love ya!
And I want you to know right now
I love ya!
And I want you to know right now
'Cause I that I
I want to give you some love, oh-ooh
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
Oh, I I want to give you some love
Sayin' I want to give you some good, good lovin'
Turn your lights down low, wo-oh
Never never try to resist, oh no
Ooh, let my love ooh, let my love come tumbling in
Into our life again
Oh, I want to give you some good, good lovin' (good, good lovin')
